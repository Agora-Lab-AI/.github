# 🌌 Agora: Advancing Humanity Through Open-Source Multi-Modality AI Research 🌠

<!-- ![Agora Banner](agora-benner.png) -->

Agora is a collective of creators pioneering an ambitious journey towards advancing humanity through artificial intelligence. 

We're exploring and promoting the principles of interconnectedness and shapelessness, developing formless and dynamical AI systems that adapt in real-time. We're taking inspiration from the boundless cosmos, crafting AI that is as diverse, dynamic, and interconnected as the universe itself. 🌙✨

Our research revolves around these guiding principles:

* 🌐 **Multi-modal Approach:** Utilizing AI to process and reason with multiple forms of data.
* 💧 **Adaptability:** Models that are as fluid as water, capable of being fine-tuned and trained in real-time.
* 🌲 **Reasoning:** Our work aims to achieve superintelligence as swiftly as possible. To this end, we strive to augment models' reasoning capabilities through innovative prompting techniques like the Tree of Thoughts or Forest of Thoughts.

Our ultimate goal is to foster the development of superintelligent AI that can reason across modalities, tasks, and environments.

## 🎇 Our Projects

We're currently working on 40+ groundbreaking projects. The majority are on [Kye's github](https://github.com/kyegomez) and [Agora's](https://github.com/Agora-X). Each represents a star in our celestial quest for AI advancement:

### [Andromeda 🌌](https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda)
Andromeda is an ultra-fast foundation language model capable of processing inputs greater than 100,000+ tokens. It's a stepping stone towards realizing our vision of AI with enhanced reasoning abilities.

### [Kosmos-X 🌕](https://github.com/kyegomez/Kosmos-X)
Kosmos-X is a multi-modality foundation model that can process vision, audio, images, and more. By combining different modalities, Kosmos-X represents a leap towards more comprehensive and interconnected AI systems.

### [Ocean 🌊](https://github.com/kyegomez/Ocean)
Ocean is a new-generation ultra-fast, ultra-reliable multi-modality native vector database. It serves as the backbone for our projects, providing robust support for multi-modal data processing and storage.

### [StarLight Vision ✨](https://github.com/kyegomez/StarlightVision)
StarLight Vision pushes the boundary of digital media by providing long-form text-to-video generation capabilities. It's an exciting venture into the future of content creation and consumption.

### [Swarms 🪐](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)
Swarms facilitates the creation of swarms of AI agents, opening new possibilities for distributed AI tasks, crowd-based learning, and explorations of emergent behaviors.
